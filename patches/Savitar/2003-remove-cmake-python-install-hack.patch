Description: Install to correct site-packages dir, based on Python version.
  The Debian hack in CMakeLists was removed upstream, but python3 doesn't
  report a Python-specific site-packages folder.
  This is required, because SIP packages need to be compiled and installed
  for every Python version separately.
